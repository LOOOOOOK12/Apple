            <h3>Benefits of apples</h3>
            <p>
              Apples offer a range of health benefits due to their fiber-rich
              composition, aiding digestion and promoting gut health. Packed
              with vitamin C and antioxidants, they strengthen the immune system
              and protect cells from oxidative damage. Regular consumption of
              apples is associated with improved heart health and weight
              management, making them a delicious and nutritious addition to any
              diet.
